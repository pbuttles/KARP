# KARP
Keysight and Razorbill Product Control Tool (KARP) is an instrument control, measurement, and real-time data collection and visualization tool. It is useful for controlling the Keysight E4980AL Capacitance Bridge and the RP100 Power Supply, compatible with the entire suite of Razorbill products.

This is the product of a summer internship at Rutgers University in the Laboratory for Artificial Quantum Materials (LAQM), spearheaded by Dr. Jak Chakhalian. This was completed under the guidance of PhD candidate Tsung-Chi Wu, who served as a research mentor for the project and is this software's primary user.
